<div class="unindent">uring the year 1840 I visited
Leipzig with letters of introduction
from Herr Klingemann of
the Hanoverian Legation in London.
I was a singer, young,
enthusiastic, and eager&mdash;as some
singers unfortunately are not&mdash;to be a musician
as well. Klingemann had many friends
among the famous German composers, because
of his personal charm, and because
his simple verses had provided them with
excellent material for the sweet little songs
the Germans love so well. I need scarcely
say that the man I most desired to meet in
Leipzig was Mendelssohn; and so, armed
with Klingemann's letter, I eagerly went to
his residence&mdash;a quiet, well-appointed house
near the Promenade. I was admitted without
delay, and shown into the composer's room.
It was plainly a musician's work-room, yet
it had a note of elegance that surprised me.
Musicians are not a tidy race; but here there
was none of the admired disorder that one
instinctively associates with an artist's sanctum.
There was no litter. The well-used
pianoforte could be approached without circuitous
negotiation of a rampart of books and
papers, and the chairs were free from encumbrances.
On a table stood some large
sketch-books, one open at a page containing
an excellent landscape drawing; and other
spirited sketches hung framed upon the walls.
The abundant music paper was perhaps the
most strangely tidy feature of the room, for
the exquisitely neat notation that covered it
suggested the work of a careful copyist rather
than the original hand of a composer. I
could not refrain from looking at one piece.
It was a very short and very simple Adagio
cantabile in the Key of F for a solo pianoforte.
It appealed at once to me as a singer,
for its quiet, unaffected melody seemed made
to be sung rather than to be played. The
"cantabile" of its heading was superfluous&mdash;it
was a Song without Words, evidently one
of a new set, for I knew it was none of the
old. But the sound of a footstep startled me
and I guiltily replaced the sheet. The door
opened, and I was warmly greeted in excellent
English by the man who entered. I
had no need to be told that it was Felix
Mendelssohn Bartholdy himself.</div>

<p>Nature is strangely freakish in her choice
of instruments for noble purposes. Sometimes
the delicate spirit of creative genius is
housed in a veritable tenement of clay, so
that what is within seems ever at war with
what is without. At times the antagonism
is more dreadful still, and the artist-soul is
sent to dwell in the body of a beast, coarse
in speech and habit, ignorant and dull in
mind, vile and unclean in thought. But sometimes
Nature is generous, and makes the
body itself an expression of the informing
spirit. Mendelssohn was one of these almost
rare instances. In him, artist and man were
like a beautiful picture appropriately framed.
He was then thirty-one. In figure he was
slim and rather below the middle height, and
he moved with the easy grace of an accomplished
dancer. Masses of long dark hair
crowned his finely chiselled face; but what I
noticed first and last was the pair of lustrous,
dark brown eyes that glowed and dilated with
every deep emotion. He had the quiet,
assured manner of a master; yet I was not
so instantly conscious of that, as of an air of
reverence and benignity, which, combined
with the somewhat Oriental tendency of feature
and colour, made his whole personality
suggest that of a young poet-prophet of Israel.</p>

<p>"So," he said, his English gaining piquancy
from his slight lisp, "you come from England&mdash;from
dear England. I love your country
greatly. It has fog, and it is dark, too, for
the sun forgets to shine at times; but it is
beautiful&mdash;like a picture, and when it smiles,
what land is sweeter?"</p>

<p>"You have many admirers in England,
sir," I replied; "perhaps I may rather say
you have many friends there."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with a bright smile, "call
them friends, for I am a friend to all
England. Even in the glowing sun of Italy
I have thought with pleasure of your dear,
smoky London, which seems to wrap itself
round one like a friendly cloak. It was
England that gave me my first recognition as
a serious musician, when Berlin was merely
inclined to think that I was an interesting
young prodigy with musical gifts that were
very amusing in a young person of means."</p>

<p>"You have seen much of England, have
you not, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A great deal," he replied, "and of
Scotland and Wales, too. I have heard the
Highland pipers in Edinburgh, and I have stood
in Queen Mary's tragic palace of Holyrood.
Yes, and I have been among the beautiful hills
that the great Sir Walter has described so
wonderfully."</p>

<p>"And," I added, "music-lovers do not
need to be told that you have also penetrated<br />
<span class="ind4">'The silence of the seas</span><br />
<span class="ind4">&nbsp;Among the farthest Hebrides.'"</span>
</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, smiling, "you like my
Overture, then?"</p>

<p>I hastened to assure him that I admired it
greatly; and he continued, with glowing eyes:
"What a wonder is the Fingal's Cave&mdash;that
vast cathedral of the seas, with its dark, lapping
waters within, and the brightness of the
gleaming waves outside!"</p>

<p>Almost instinctively he sat down at the
piano, and began to play, as if his feelings must
express themselves in tones rather than words.
His playing was most remarkable for its
orchestral quality. Unsuspected power lay in
those delicate hands, for at will they seemed
able to draw from the piano a full orchestral
volume, and to suggest, if desired, the peculiar
tones of solo instruments.</p>

<p>This Overture of his is made of the
sounds of the sea. There is first a theme
that suggests the monotonous wash of the
waters and the crying of sea-birds within
the vast spaces of the cavern. Then follows a
noble rising passage, as if the spirit of the place
were ascending from the depths of the sea and
pervading with his presence the immensity of
his ocean fane. This, in its turn, is succeeded
by a movement that seems to carry us into the
brightness outside, though still the plaint of
crying birds pursues us in haunting monotony.
It is a wonderful piece, this Hebrides Overture,
with all the magic and the mystery of the
Islands about it.</p>

<p>"That is but one of my Scottish impressions,"
said Mendelssohn; "I have many more,
and I am trying to weave them into a Scottish
Symphony to match the Italian."</p>

<p>"You believe in a programme then?"
I asked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!" he answered; "moreover I
believe that most composers have a programme
implicit in their minds, even though they may
not recognise it. But always one must keep
within the limits of the principle inscribed by
Beethoven at the head of his Pastoral Symphony,
'More an expression of the feelings than a
painting.' Music cannot paint. It is on a
different plane of time. A painting must leap
to the eye, but a musical piece unfolds itself
slowly. If music tries to paint it loses its
greatest glory&mdash;the power of infinite, immeasurable
suggestion. Beethoven, quite allowably,
and in a purely humorous fashion, used a few
touches of realism; but his Pastoral Symphony
is not a painting, it is not even descriptive; it is
a musical outpouring of emotion, and enshrines
within its notes all the sweet peaceful brightness
of an early summer day. To think of it," he
added, rising in his enthusiasm, "is to be happy
with the innocence of pure joy."</p>

<p>I was relieved of the necessity of replying
by a diversion without the door. Two male
voices were heard declaiming in a sort of mock-melodramatic
duet, "Are you at home, are you
at home? May we enter, may we enter?"</p>

<p>"Come in, you noisy fellows," exclaimed
Mendelssohn gaily; and two men entered.
The elder, who was of Mendelssohn's age,
carried a violin case, and saluted the composer
with a flourish of the music held in his other
hand. "Hail you second Beethoven!" he
exclaimed. Suddenly he observed my presence
and hushed his demonstrations, giving me a
courteous, and humorously penitent salutation.
Mendelssohn introduced us.</p>

<p>"This," he said to me "is Mr. Ferdinand
David, the great violinist and leader of our
orchestra; and this," indicating the younger
visitor, "is a countryman of yours, Mr.
Sterndale Bennett. We think a great deal of
Mr. Bennett in Leipzig."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" said David to me; "you've
come to the right house in Leipzig if you're an
Englishman. Mendelssohn dotes on you all,
doesn't he, Bennett?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bennett, "and we dote on
him. I left all the young ladies in England
singing 'Ist es wahr.'"</p>

<p>"Ist es wahr? ist es wahr?" carolled
David, in lady-like falsetto, with comic exaggeration
of anguish sentiment.</p>

<p>Bennett put his hands to his ears with an
expression of anguish, saying, "Spare us,
David; you play like an angel, but you sing
like&mdash;well, I leave it to you?"</p>

<p>"And I forgot to mention," said Mendelssohn
with a gay laugh, "that our young
English visitor is a singer bringing ecstatic
recommendations from Klingemann."</p>

<p>"Ah! a rival!" said David, with a
dramatic gesture; "but since we're all of a
trade, perhaps our friend will show he doesn't
mind my nonsense by singing this song to us."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mendelssohn, with a graceful
gesture, "I shall be greatly pleased if
you will."</p>

<p>I could not refuse. Mendelssohn sat
down at the piano and I began the simple
song that has helped so many English people
to appreciate the beauties of the German <i>lied</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Mendelssohn
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" exclaimed David; "but our
Mendelssohn can do more than make pretty
songs. This," he continued, indicating the
music he had brought, "is going to be something
great!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Mendelssohn
quietly, yet with eyes that gleamed intensely.</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," said David emphatically.
"There is plenty of music for violin and
orchestra&mdash;oceans of it; but there has been
hitherto only one real great big Concerto,"&mdash;he
spread his arms wide as he spoke. "Now
there will be two."</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed Mendelssohn
quickly; "if I finish this Concerto it will be
with no impious intention of competing with
Beethoven. You see, for one thing, I have
begun it quite differently."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded David, and he began to
drum on the table in the rhythm of Beethoven's
fateful knocking at the door; "yes,
Beethoven was before all a symphonist&mdash;his
Concerto is a Symphony in D major with
violin obbligato."</p>

<p>"Observe," murmured Bennett, "the
blessing of a musical temperament. A
drunken man thumps monotonously at his
door in the depths of night. To an Englishman
it suggests calling the police; to Beethoven
it suggests a symphony."</p>

<p>"Well, David," said Mendelssohn, "it's
to be your Concerto, so I want you to discuss
it with me in all details. I am the most
devoted admirer of your playing, but I have,
as well, the sincerest respect for your
musicianship."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said David with a smile
of deep pleasure; and turning to me he
added, "I really called to play this over
with the master. Shall you mind if I scratch
it through?"</p>

<p>I tried to assure him of the abiding
pleasure that I, a young stranger, would
receive from being honoured by permission
to remain.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," he said unaffectedly;
"we are all in the trade, you
know; you sing, I play."</p>

<p>Mendelssohn sat at the piano and David
tuned his instrument. Mendelssohn used no
copy. His memory was prodigious. The
violin gave out a beautiful melody that soared
passionately, yet gracefully, above an accompaniment,
simple at first, but growing gradually
more intense and insistent till a great climax
was reached, after which the solo voice sank
slowly to a low, whispering murmur, while
the piano played above it a succession of
sweetly delicate and graceful phrases. The
movement was worked out with the utmost
complexity and brilliance, but came suddenly
to an end. The playing of the two masters
was beyond description.</p>

<p>"The cadenza is subject to infinite alteration,"
remarked Mendelssohn; and turning to
me, he continued, "the movement is unfinished,
you see; and even what is written
may be greatly changed. I fear I am a
fastidious corrector. I am rarely satisfied with
my first thoughts."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think much change is
wanted here," said David. "I'm longing to
have the rest of it. When will it be ready?"</p>

<p>Mendelssohn shook his head with a smile.
"Ask me for it in five years, David."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, Bennett?" asked
the violinist.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that we are in the garden
of Eden," said Bennett, oracularly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Mendelssohn.</p>

<p>"This," explained Bennett: "there seems to
me something essentially and exquisitely
feminine about this movement, just as in
Beethoven's Concerto there is something essentially
and heroically masculine. In other words,
he has made the Adam of Concertos, and you
have mated it with the Eve. Henceforth," he
continued, waving his hands in benediction,
"the tribe of Violin Concertos shall increase and
multiply and become as the stars of heaven in
multitude."</p>

<p>"The more the merrier," cried David, "at
least for fiddlers&mdash;I don't know what the
audiences will think."</p>

<p>"Audiences don't think&mdash;at least, not in
England," said Bennett.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" interposed Mendelssohn;
and turning to me with a smile he said, "Will
you allow Mr. Bennett to slander your countrymen
like this?"</p>

<p>"But Mr. Bennett doesn't mean it," I
replied; "he knows that English audiences love,
and are always faithful to, what stirs them
deeply."</p>

<p>"Yes; but what does stir them deeply?" he
asked; "look at the enormous popularity of
senseless sentimental songs."</p>

<p>"On the other hand," I retorted, "look at
our old affection for Handel and our new
affection for Mr. Mendelssohn himself."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mendelssohn, with a
smile; "Handel is certainly yours by adoption.
You English love the Bible, and Handel knew
well how to wed its beautiful words to noble
music. He was happy in having at his command
the magnificent prose of the Bible and the
magnificent verses of Milton. I, too, am fascinated
by the noble language of the Scriptures,
and I have used it both in the vernacular and in
the sounding Latin of the Vulgate. And I am
haunted even now by the words of one of the
Psalms which seem to call for an appropriate
setting. You recall the verses?</p>

&nbsp;Take heed unto me, and hear me,<br />
&nbsp;how I mourn in my prayer and am vexed.<br /><br />

&nbsp;The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Yes," said David, nodding emphatically;
"they are wonderful words; you must certainly
set them."</p>

<p>"The Bible is an inexhaustible mine of song
and story for musical setting," continued
Mendelssohn; "I have one of its stories in my
mind now; but only one man, a greater even
than Handel, was worthy to touch the supreme
tragedy of all."</p>

<p>The last words were murmured as if to
himself rather than to us, and he accompanied
them abstractedly with tentative, prelusive
chords, which gradually grew into the most
strangely moving music I have ever heard.</p>

<p>Its complex, swelling phrases presently
drew together and rose up in one great major
chord. No one spoke. I felt as if some
mighty spirit had been evoked and that its
unseen presence overshadowed us.</p>

<p>"What was it?" I presently whispered to
Bennett; but he shook his head and said,
"Wait; he will tell you."</p>

<p>At length I turned to Mendelssohn and
said, "Is that part of the new work of yours
you mentioned just now?"</p>

<p>"Of mine!" he exclaimed; "of mine!
I could never write such music. No, no!
That was Bach, John Sebastian Bach&mdash;part
of his St. Matthew Passion. I was playing
not so much the actual notes of any chorus,
but rather the effect of certain passages as I
could feel them in my mind."</p>

<p>"So that was by Bach!" I said in wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mendelssohn; "and people
know so little of him. They either think of
him as the composer of mathematical exercises
in music, or else they confuse him
with others of his family. He was Cantor
of the St. Thomas School here in Leipzig,
the perfect type of a true servant of our
glorious art. He wrote incessantly, but the
greatest of his works lay forgotten after his
death; and it was I, I, who disinterred this
marvellous music-drama of the Passion, and
gave it in Berlin ten years ago&mdash;its first performance
since Bach's death almost a century
before. But there," he added, with an apologetic
smile, "I talk too much! Let us speak
of something else."</p>

<p>"Yes," said David, "you will talk of
Bach for ever if no one stops you. Not that
I mind. I am a disciple, too."</p>

<p>"And I, too," added Bennett. "I mean
to emulate Mendelssohn. He was the first
to give the 'Passion' in Germany, I will be
the first to give it in England."</p>

<p>"Then I'll be recording angel," said
David, "and register your vow. You'll show
him up, if he breaks his word, won't you?"
he added, turning to me.</p>

<p>"Now this will really change the subject,"
said Mendelssohn, producing a sheet of
manuscript. "Here is a little song I wrote
last year to some old verses. Perhaps our
new friend will let us hear it."</p>

<p>In great trepidation I took the sheet. It
was headed simply "Volkslied." I saw at
once that there would be no difficulty in
reading it, for the music was both <ins title="original has grateful">graceful</ins>
and simple.</p>

<p>"Shall we try?" asked Mendelssohn,
with his quiet, reassuring smile.</p>

<p>"If you are willing to let me," I
answered.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Bennett.</p>

<p>"Say rather, 'Bravi,'" said David, "for
the song was as sweet as the singer."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bennett; "the simple repetition
of the closing words of each verse is
like a sigh of regret."</p>

<p>"And the whole thing," added David,
"has the genuine simplicity of the true folk-melody."</p>

<p>Further discussion was prevented by a
characteristic knock at the door.</p>

<p>The visitor who entered in response to
Mendelssohn's call was a sturdily built man
of thirty, or thereabouts, with an air of
mingled courage, resolution, and good humour.
His long straight hair was brushed back from
a broad, intellectual brow, and his thoughtful,
far-looking eyes intensified the impression he
gave of force and original power. He smiled
humorously. "All the youth, beauty and
intellect of Leipzig in one room. I leave you
to apportion the qualities. Making much noise,
too! And did I hear the strains of a vocal
recital?"</p>

<p>"You did," replied Bennett; "that was
my young countryman here, who has just
been singing a new song of Mendelssohn's."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the new-comer to
me; "you see Mendelssohn so fills the stage
everywhere, that even David gets over-*looked
sometimes, don't you, my inspired
fiddler?" he added, slapping the violinist
on the back.</p>

<p>"Yes I do," said David, "and so do the
manners of all of you, for no one introduces our
singer;" and turning to me he added, "this is
Mr. Robert Schumann who divides the musical
firmament of Leipzig with Mendelssohn."</p>

<p>"You forget to add," said Mendelssohn,
"that Schumann conquers in literature as well
as in music. No one has written better musical
critiques."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," grumbled David; "I wish he
wouldn't do so much of it. If he scribbled less
he'd compose more. The cobbler should stick
to his last, and the musician shouldn't relinquish
the music-pen for the goose quill."</p>

<p>"But what of Mendelssohn himself," urged
Schumann; "he, in a special sense, is a man of
letters; for if there's one thing as good as being
with him, it is being away from him, and
receiving his delightful epistles."</p>

<p>"Not the same thing," said David, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>"And then," said Schumann, waving his
hand comprehensively around the room,
"observe his works of art."</p>

<p>I was about to express my astonishment at
finding that Mendelssohn himself had produced
these admirable pictures; but David suddenly
addressed me: "By the way, don't let
Mendelssohn decoy you into playing billiards
with him; or if you do weakly yield, insist on
fifty in the hundred&mdash;unless, of course, you have
misspent your time, too, in gaining disreputable
proficiency;" and he shook his head at the
thought of many defeats.</p>

<p>"Certainly," exclaimed Schumann, "Mendelssohn
does all things well."</p>

<p>"That's a handsome admission from a
rival," said David.</p>

<p>"A rival!" answered Schumann with
spirit. "There can be no talk of rivalry
between us. I know my place. Mendelssohn
and I differ about things, sometimes; but who
could quarrel with him?"</p>

<p>"I could!" exclaimed David, jumping up,
and striking an heroic attitude.</p>

<p>"You!" laughed Schumann; "You
quarrel, you dear old scraper of unmentionable
strings!"</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! my boy," chuckled David,
"you can't write for them."</p>

<p>"You mean I don't write for them," said
Schumann; "I admit that I don't provide
much for you to do. I leave that to my
betters."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said David, giving his
shoulder a friendly pat; "at least you can
write for the piano. I believe in you, and
your queer music."</p>

<p>"That's nice of you, David," replied
Schumann, "but as to Mendelssohn and me,
who shall decide which of us is right? He
believes in making music as pellucid to the
hearers as clear water. Now I like to baffle
them&mdash;to leave them something to struggle
with. Music is never the worse for being
obscure at first."</p>

<p>Mendelssohn shook his head and smiled.
"You state your case eloquently, Schumann,"
he said, "but my feelings revolt against darkness
and indefiniteness."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," assented Schumann; "you
are the Fairies' Laureate."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried David. "Now
could anything be finer in its way than the
Midsummer Night's Dream music? And the
wondrous brat wrote it at seventeen!"</p>

<p>Mendelssohn laughingly acknowledged the
compliments.</p>

<p>"That is a beautiful fairy song of yours,"
I said, "the one to Heine's verses about the
fairies riding their tiny steeds through the
wood."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Schumann; "will you
sing it to us?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid it requires much lighter
singing than I can give it," I replied; "but
I will try, if you wish."</p>

<p>"We shall all be glad if you will," said
Mendelssohn, as he turned once more to the
key-board. The bright staccato rhythm
flashed out from his fingers so gaily that I
was swept into the song without time for
hesitation:</p>

<p>"You have greatly obliged us," said
Schumann courteously.</p>

<p>"It reminds me, though I don't know
why," said David, "of that fairy-like duet
about Jack Frost and the dancing flowers."</p>

<p>"Come along and play it with me," said
Mendelssohn to Bennett; "you've been
hiding your talents all day."</p>

<p>Bennett joined him at the piano, and the
two began to romp like schoolboys.</p>

<p>The simple duet was woven into a brilliant
fantasia, but always in the gay spring-like spirit
of the poem.</p>

<p>"Really," said David; "it's quite infectious";
and jumping up he began to pirouette,
exclaiming, "Then why should I not go!"</p>

<p>"David, this is unseemly," exclaimed
Schumann, with mock severity. "There's
another pretty fairy-like piece of yours,
Mendelssohn, the Capriccio in E minor."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bennett, beginning to touch
its opening fanfare of tiny trumpet-notes;
"someone told me a pretty story of this
piece, to the effect that a young lady gave you
some flowers, and you undertook, gallantly,
to write the music the Fairies played on the
little trumpet-like blooms."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mendelssohn, with a smile,
"it was in Wales, and I wrote the piece for
Miss Taylor."</p>

<p>"By-the-by," said Schumann, "David's
antics remind me that Mendelssohn can
make Witches and other queer creatures,
dance, as well as Fairies."</p>

<p>"Villain," exclaimed David, and he began
to recite dramatically the invocation from the
"First Walpurgis Night," while Mendelssohn
played the flashing accompaniment.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mendelssohn, "I don't think
the old poet would really have cared for my
setting, though he admired my playing, and
was always most friendly to me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Schumann, warmly; "Goethe
liked you because you were successful, and
prosperous. Now Beethoven was poor:
therefore Beethoven must first be loftily
patronised and then contemptuously snubbed.
I can never forgive Goethe for that. And
as for poor Schubert, well, Goethe ignored
him, and actually thought he had misinterpreted
the Erl-king! It would be comic if it
were not painful."</p>

<p>"Poor Schubert!" said Mendelssohn
with a sigh; "he met always Fortune's frown,
never her smile."</p>

<p>"Don't you think," said Bennett, "that
his genius was the better for his poverty&mdash;that
he learned in suffering what he taught
in song?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not!" replied Mendelssohn
warmly. "That is a vile doctrine invented
by a callous world to excuse its cruelty."</p>

<p>"I believe there's something in it, though,"
said Bennett.</p>

<p>"There is some truth in it, but not
much," answered Mendelssohn, his eyes flashing
as he spoke. "It is true that the artist
learns by suffering, because the artist is
more sensitive and feels more deeply than
others. But enough of suffering comes to all
of us, even the most fortunate, without the
sordid, gratuitous misery engendered by
poverty."</p>

<p>"I agree with Mendelssohn," said Schumann.
"To say that poverty is the proper
stimulus of genius is to talk pernicious nonsense.
Poverty slays, it does not nourish;
poverty narrows the vision, it does not
ennoble; poverty lowers the moral standard
and makes a man sordid. You can't get
good art out of that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have been more fortunate than
most artists," said Mendelssohn softly. "When
I think of all that my dear father and mother
did for us, I can scarcely restrain tears of
gratitude. Almost more valuable than their
careful encouragement was their noble, serious
common-sense. My mother, whom Heaven
long preserve to me, was not the woman to let
me, or any of us, live in a fool's paradise, and
my dear dead father was too good a man of
business to set me walking in a blind alley.
Ah!" he continued, with glistening eyes, "the
great musical times we had in the dear old
Berlin house!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said David; "Your house was on
the Leipzig Road. You see, even then, the
finger of fate pointed the way to this place."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Schumann, with a sigh,
"You certainly had extraordinary opportunities.
Not that I've been badly used, though."</p>

<p>"Your father was genuinely proud of you,"
said David. "I remember his epigram: 'Once
I was the son of my father; now I am the
father of my son.'"</p>

<p>Mendelssohn nodded with a smile, and,
turning to me, said in explanation, "You must
know that my father's father was a famous
philosopher."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Schumann, rising, "I must
be going."</p>

<p>Bennett and David also prepared to leave,
and I rose with them.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Mendelssohn; and
going to the door he called softly, "Cecile, are
you there?"</p>

<p>He went out for a moment, and returned
with a beautiful and charming girl, who greeted
the three visitors warmly.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn then presented me, saying,
gently and almost proudly, "This is my wife."</p>

<p>I bowed deeply.</p>

<p>"You are from England?" said the lady,
with the sweetest of smiles; "I declare I am
quite jealous of your country, my husband loves
it so much."</p>

<p>"We are very proud of his affection," I
replied.</p>

<p>She turned to Schumann and said softly,
"And how is Clara?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is well;" he replied with a glad
smile.</p>

<p>"And the father?" she added.</p>

<p>"We have been much worried," he said
gravely; "but we shall marry this year in
spite of all he may do."</p>

<p>"She is worth all your struggles," said
Mendelssohn warmly; "she is a charming lady,
and an excellent musician. You will be very
happy."</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks," replied Schumann, with
evident pleasure.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn turned to me and shook
my hand warmly. "I have been glad to meet
you, and to hear you; for you sing like a
musician. I shall not say good-bye. You will
call again, I hope, before you leave Leipzig.
Perhaps we may meet, too, in England. I am
now writing something that I hope my English
friends will like."</p>

<p>"What is it, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is an oratorio on the subject of
Elijah," he replied.</p>

<p>"It is bound to be good," said Schumann
enthusiastically. "Posterity will call you the
man who never failed."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mendelssohn almost sadly,
"you are all good and kind, but you praise me
too much. Perhaps posterity will remember
me for my little pieces rather than for my
greater efforts. Perhaps it will remember me
best, not as the master, but as the servant; for
in my way I have tried very hard to glorify the
great men who went before me&mdash;Bach, Mozart,
Beethoven, Schubert&mdash;Bach most of all. Even
if every note of my writing should perish,
perhaps future generations will think kindly of
me, remembering that it was I, the Jew by
birth, who gave back to Christianity that
imperishable setting of its tragedy and glory."</p>

<p>With these words in my ears I passed out
into the pleasant streets of Mendelssohn's
chosen city.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
